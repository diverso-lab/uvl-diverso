# UVL parser

## Documentation

Documentation for UVL can be found in the project's [wiki](https://github.com/diverso-lab/uvl-diverso/wiki)

## Dev

This python UVL parser for diverso project is generated by [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) from the UVL.g4 file, where the grammar is defined. In order to generate the UVL*.py files, first we need to install antlr python runtime:

```
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
```

Then, this command should generate the files we need for the parser to work:


```
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -no-listener UVL.g4
```

After that, get_tree.py gives us a method that, when given an uvl file via absolute path, a ParseTree object is returned. ParseTree is an ANTLR object which represents an AST-ish structure of the file we read with the defined grammar.

[This file] performs a transformation from an ANTLR ParseTree to a fm_metamodel-structured FM. Pretty much every way to obtain data from this ParseTree can be seen there.
